# Hello. Welcome to my GitHub.
### 🐌
I'm a psycholinguist who is interested in sentence processing of ambiguous structures by different bilingual profiles.

I've also developed a few computational projects, such as analyzing child speech for the emergence of word classes and grammar, using Twitter geodata to analyze tweets, a knock-knock joke generator based on phonetic distance, and prompt engineering of medical abstracts drug-drug interactions.
