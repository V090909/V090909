## Hello! Welcome to my projects.
### üêå
I'm a psycholinguist who is interested in how humans make sense of the variety of signals present in linguistic information. Specifically, how do comprehenders weight syntactic and semantic cues (sometimes congruous, sometines conflicting) during sentence processing? To solve one aspect of this puzzle, I study real-time comprehension of ambiguous structures by bilingual populations.

My projects include analyzing child speech for the emergence of word classes and grammar, using Twitter geodata to compare user metrics in different locations, calculating phonetic distance between two words based on vectorized IPA features, and prompt engineering LLMS for the extraction of drug-drug interactions from medical abstracts.
