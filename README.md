# Hello. Welcome to my projects.
### üêå
I'm a psycholinguist who is interested in the sentence processing of ambiguous structures by bilinguals.

I've also developed a few computational projects, such as analyzing child speech for the emergence of word classes and grammar, using Twitter geodata to analyze tweets, a calculator of phonetic distance between two words based on vectorized IPA features, and prompt engineering of medical abstracts drug-drug interactions.
